# GWC Intermediate Week6

Welcome back everyone! We hope you all had a great weekend, and are ready to learn something new. Before we get started, let's spend some time work on a challenge to recall your memory.

### Recap Exercise

Write a Python Module that contains a simple math function called `multiply2`. The function should:
* Take in an number
* Multiply it by 2
* print the number

Then save the module as `times2.py` and open a new file that:
* Imports the `times2.py` using `import`
* Call the multiply2 function with any input number
