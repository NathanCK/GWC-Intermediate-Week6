# GWC Intermediate Week6

Welcome back everyone! We hope you all had a great weekend, and are ready to learn something new. Before we get started, let's spend some time work on a challenge to recall your memory.

### Recap Exercise

Write a Python Module that contains a simple math function called `multiply2`. The function should:
* Take in an number
* Multiply it by 2
* print the number

Then save the module as `times2.py` and open a new file that:
* Imports the `times2.py` using `import`
* Call the multiply2 function with any input number

After you finish the exercise, raise your hand and let one of your TAs know before you move on to the next part!

## More Python
### Python Dictionaries

Last week we learnt how to write our own module, and how we can apply it to simple user interface for Chatbot. Today, we start learning a new data structure, dictionaries!

A dictionary is a collection of data which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.

* Take a look at the following code and think what it should return:
```
person =	{
    "name": "Cindy",
    "age": 20,
    "pet": "cat"
  }
  print(person)
```
Now open your IDLE, create a new file and run the above code. Does the result match with what you think? Ask TAs for explanations and make sure you understand before going further.
